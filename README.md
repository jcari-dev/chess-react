## 🎯 Project Vision

PlayChess leverages the best of modern web technologies to bring you a seamless, real-time chess playing experience. With room-based multiplayer functionality, comprehensive move validation, and soon, AI-based opponents powered by Stockfish, PlayChess is more than just a game—it's my most technical personal project so far.

## 🚀 Features

- **Real-Time Multiplayer**: Create a room and challenge a friend or a foe with a unique URL.
- **Move Validation**: Ensures all moves adhere to official chess rules, with visual aids.
- **AI Opponents (Coming Soon 👀)**: Practice your skills against AI with varying difficulty levels, powered by the formidable Stockfish engine.
- **User registration (Coming Soon 🤞)**: Via OAuth and the supported social media connections! 
- **Match History (Coming Soon 🙏)**: Re-watch a room's match history.

## 🛠 Built With

### Frontend
- **React** and **[Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/)** come together to create a responsive and visually appealing interface. React's efficiency pairs perfectly with Chakra UI's component library for rapid UI development.

### Backend
- **Django** provides the robust backend framework needed for secure API endpoints, smooth room management, and reliable user authentication, all while facilitating quick development.

### Database
- **PostgreSQL** My choice for its robustness, handling complex game states and user data with efficiency and reliability, perfectly scaling with our application's growth, also very nice integration with Django.
